# stock-analysis1
## Overview of Analysis
Steve is interested in expanding the dataset and he wants to look at the entire stock market over the last couple of years (2017 and 2018).Our job is to refactor the code and to amke the code more efficient by having fewer steps and using less memorey. This way when Steve is looking up a dataset that has thousands of stocks versus only a dozen stocks, it's still running efficently and isn't taking super long to load. 
## Results 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

#### Advantages
1. Code is more efficent and takes less time to execute
2. Code is cleaner and easier to update
3. Refactring helps find bugs in advance and can improve code design
#### Disadvantages
1. Could introduce new errors and bugs
2. Could cost more money
3. Could also take more time to go through and refactor code

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
